We usually live well for about 65 years. During this period, we can accomplish many things in our lives and our communities. But what after those 65 years?

Some daily activities start to be difficult to complete. We learn to overcome these new challenges by accepting that certain tasks will take a little more time than usual and by reducing the number of tasks to execute. As long as these tasks do not limit us too much, we can always seem active and engaging in the eyes of our loved ones. For most of us, it is very painful to accept that we’ve become more and more dependent over time. We tend to hide or lie because we are refusing to see that we now need more help and assistance and because we don’t want our family and friends to worry. Challenging and accepting this harsh reality is not an easy subject for the aging person or their loved ones. 

However, children, friends, or neighbours eventually become aware of the situation and a number of questions arise, especially when the elder lives alone at home and shows signs of dependence like forgetfulness, loss of habits or even a fall. It is then that relatives begin to look for effective ways to protect and assist their loved one.

One way is the installation of sensors connected to a computer program that would record and analyze the elder’s behavior. Such a system could help the elder and his surrounding anticipate a growth of dependence, prevent accidents and allow the elder to stay at home in his/her environment for a longer period of time. 

What do you think? How would you protect our elders?
