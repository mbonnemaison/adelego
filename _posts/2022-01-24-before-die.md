After a tree is born, it grows, slowly declines and then dies. Throughout its life, a tree must adapt to years of challenges such as the cold of harsh winters, the heat and drought of summers, the wind, tornadoes, rain and thunderstorms to resist death. When a tree is dying, it starts to lose its branches, develops holes in its trunk, and is attacked by insects and fungi. Even when most of the tree is gone, it is still able to develop a few leaves. A tree struggles to live for many years before death takes it.

The same is true for humans. We are born, grow up, slowly decline and then die. Once we have reached maturity in our twenties, we start declining. We try to slow this process by maintaining a healthy lifestyle through good food and regular physical activity. As we grow older, we start to face the fact that we need to be helped and supported in everyday life. Most of us want or will want to stay at home for as long as possible to maintain the same social life and remain connected to the numerous memories we will have created over the years.

In addition to becoming more dependent on others, family and relatives (who do not always live nearby) tend to worry when they realize that we canâ€™t maintain our autonomy like we used to. So, what can we do to continue living in the same home while preserving our safety? Adelego project suggests the installation of sensors at home to measure our habits and detect deviations from normal. Such a system can help reassure ourselves and our loved ones if an accident happens or a growing problem is developing. What would be your solution?
