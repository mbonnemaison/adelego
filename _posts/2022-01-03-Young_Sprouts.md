What if we solve our societal problems like a sprout starting from the ground and rising to the sky? 

For a seed to germinate, there needs a favorable environment that includes water, light, heat and good soil. Otherwise the seed either waits for a better time to develop or dies on its own. In principle, no higher entity is essentially needed for the plant to grow.

However, even when all these conditions are met, a plant also needs luck because it can be eaten by wildlife, crushed and destroyed as it reaches its adult stage. Every plant must overcome these obstacles to make beautiful fruits, flowers and then seeds to spread.

One current challenge in our society is the rising number of caregivers and dependent people due to aging, disability or disease. For the most part, caregivers are unpaid family members who are also working for a living and must find a balance between their own life and the life of the person they care.

The Adelego project is like a young sprout that seeks only to meet the needs shared by millions of caregivers and dependent people across the globe via the use connected objects.

Like a young sprout, Adelego needs a favorable environment to grow that includes exchanges of life experiences from caregivers and dependent people and skills within the community in order to develop the best solutions to growing dependence. 
 
The overall goal of Adelego is to be free and to bring together a community that will share its needs, skills and knowledge to alleviate the suffering of aging, disability, isolation and disease around the world. Like young sprouts, it is from the community that we can all grow and rise to the sky.
