More and more people need daily help due to aging of the population.

At some point in their lives, families (who sometimes live far from their elders) will be looking for ways to make sure things are going well for their elders.

However, the current solutions for seniors and their families do not take into account one essential point: seniors are a group of individuals who have different needs and may require different care.

We thus need to provide solutions that can evolve with the dependent person’s needs, are adaptable to everyone’s situations, regardless of their age or health status, are easy to use and accessible to as many people as possible.

One way is to install motion detectors in the main rooms of the house and link them to a software that will analyze & interpret lifestyle habits with the goal of detecting any suspicious activity in the house. Examples of unusual situations include an abnormally long time spent in the bathroom, no entry in the kitchen for more than 12 hours or walking outside in the middle of the night. In these situations, an alert is sent to caregivers via email or text messages in order to better protect our elders.
