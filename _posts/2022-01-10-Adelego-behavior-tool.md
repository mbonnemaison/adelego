Aging is a main driver of dependence. However, dependence does not develop overnight in most cases. It can take months to years to be noticeable to the caregivers and seniors. One of our elders’ wishes is to live at home for as long as possible. Adelego project was created to fulfill this wish via the use of connected objects and open-source applications to improve their safety, their autonomy and the assistance they receive from caregivers.

The main idea behind Adelego is to build a system that would record daily activities such as wake up times or how long it takes to go upstairs using connected objects installed in the house. Over time, this system would be capable of analyzing the senior’s behavior and detecting a growing dependence or an unusual activity. In such a situation, Adelego could then alert the caregivers allowing them to take appropriate actions to the senior’s needs, limit accidents and prevent caregivers and seniors from making decisions hastily in situations of emergency. Adelego has thus the potential of delaying entry into assisted living residences and allowing our elders to live at home longer.

Moreover, Adelego’s recording application seeks to be flexible enough so that it can easily adapt to the evolving need of the senior. For example, an additional detector could be added in the home and the data collected from the latter device should merge with the pre-existing system.

If you are interested in this free and open-source project and would like to contribute in the development of a system that would predict malnutrition, lack of social contact or accidents like falls, we would like to hear from you.
