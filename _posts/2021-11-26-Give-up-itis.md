We talk about give-up-itis if an elderly person suddenly loses the will to live and refuses to perform essential daily habits such as eating, bathing or getting up, even though he/she was perfectly capable of doing so before the onset of the syndrome. Consequently, give-up-itis is accompanied by a loss of autonomy in the elderly’s daily life and requires the help of caregivers.

The causes can be physical like a fall causing a fracture, or psychological, such as the loss of a loved one, an upcoming surgery or hospitalization.

A sudden change in behavior like a refusal to eat or get out of bed should immediately alert the caregiver and the family. 
But this is not always easy. Even if the caregiver frequently visits the elderly, it is sometimes difficult to notice the changes in behavior and the sudden deterioration in the elderly’s health. 

If an alert is not raised early enough to help and protect the elderly’s health, the consequences can be very serious.

There are ways to monitor changes in a person's behavior by installing sensors in the home that record a person's movements, habits and frequencies. When lifestyle habits deviate from "normal", the caregiver can be alerted allowing him/her to take the necessary measures and avoid facing an emergency.
